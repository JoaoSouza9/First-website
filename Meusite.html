        The <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-an-api-in-english-please-b880a3214a82/"target="_blank">API</a>
        works like a connection between the owner of some data, which has
        built the API features and someone who want to use that data base, maybe
        for an app, for example. When you want to access other servers that's not
        of your own you may need to use an API in order to use these servers.
        It's the messenger that sends to the server what kind of information
        it's been requested and returns back what's been requested.
      </p>
      <p>
        The API is the specification for what the URL patterns are, what the syntax
        of the data we're supposed to send, what the syntax of data we can expect to
        get back. It's needed to follow its rules in oder to get what we want, and all
        those rules are into its documentation.
